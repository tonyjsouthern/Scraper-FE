# Scraper FE

This is a simple front-end for the scraper back-end.

It allows a user to input a web-address and runs a check to see if tracking scripts from any of the following companies are present:  

* Marketo
* ActOn
* Salesfusion
* Google
* ClickDimensions
* Pardot

The live URL for this site can be found at:

## Improvements
I will be adding Hubspot to the list of tracking scripts that will be checked.
